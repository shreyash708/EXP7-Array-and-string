# Title : Arrays And Strings 

# Aim: 
To study and implement different operations on arrays and strings in C++

# Tools : VS Code and C++ Compiler

# Theory :
In C++, arrays and strings are important data structures used for storing and manipulating multiple data items in a single variable. Arrays store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type, while strings are used to store sequences of characters. This document covers various operations like printing elements of an array, searching an array, calculating the sum and average of array elements, finding minimum and maximum values, string reversal, and checking for palindromes.

# Exp-7A: Printing Elements of an Array
Algorithm:

1) Start the program.
2) Declare an array arr[] with elements {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.
3) Use a for loop to iterate over the array.
4) Print each element of the array.
5) End the program

# Exp-7B: Searching for a Number in an Array
Algorithm:

1) Start the program.
2) Declare an array arr[] with elements {6, 980, 4, 0, 6543}.
3) Ask the user to enter a number to search for.
4) Use a for loop to search for the target number in the array.
5) Print if the number is found or not.
6) End the program.

# Exp-7C: Calculating Sum and Average of Array Elements
Algorithm:
1)Start the program.
2) Declare an array and input n (number of elements).
3) Use a for loop to input elements into the array.
4) Calculate the sum of elements using a loop.
5) Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n.
6) Print the sum and average.
7) End the program.

# Exp-7D: Finding Minimum and Maximum Elements in an Array
Algorithm:

1)Start the program.
2)Declare an array and input n (number of elements).
3)Initialize min and max as the first element of the array.
4)Use a for loop to compare each element of the array with min and max.
5)Print the minimum and maximum values.
6)End the program.

# Exp-7E: Printing a String in C++
Algorithm:

1)Start the program.
2)Declare a string using a character array str1 and a std::string object str2.
3)Print both strings.
4)End the program.

# Exp-7F: Concatenating Two Strings
Algorithm:

1)Start the program.
2)Declare two std::string variables str1 and str2.
3)Concatenate str1 and str2 using the + operator.
4)Print the concatenated result.
5)End the program.

# Conclusion : 
In this lab, we have learned the concepts of arrays and strings in C++ and implemented several important operations such as printing array elements, searching, finding sum/average, finding min/max values, string concatenation, reversal, and palindrome checking. These operations are foundational for manipulating data in C++ and are widely used in many applications.
